i think if it allows people to have more choice over where and when they have the examination, particularly if you don't need to be a trained mammographer to operate it, then that will help more people get regular screening. 
i'm not sure what benefit the palpation aspect gives compared to just the imaging - currently screening is just imaging with no examination unless you have identified an issue. so as a patient i would want more information on why this is better or the same as a routine mammogram.
i'm also in 2 minds about the results process. one difficult thing about being a cancer patient is waiting for results. so the possibility of having instant results is amazing. however if it's an abnormal result then that's not necessarily something you want to find out in the middle of a shopping centre or a work carpark. but knowing you get instant results if it's normal and there will be a wait if it's abnormal is just the same as telling you there is an abnormal result, if that makes sense.
mammograms are currently read by 2 radiologists before results are released. regardless of the accuracy of the system, is the double read not still important and therefore would mean that results can't be instant? even if one of the reads is taken as the machine itself and it is double checked by a radiologist? giving a patient a false positive or false negative result can be damaging. of course there will always be the risk that it will happen, but minimising this is important and more important than an instant result. 
if there is an abnormal result it will cause an amount of worry and anxiety and so any additional information that can be provided alongside the results such as emotional support and links to further information would be really useful.
i think providing lots of information about the system such as how it works, how and why its different to mammography, how it links into the national breast screening programme etc would be really useful for patients. at the moment i think it is a great concept but i'm unsure whether i would use it as i'm confident i know what a mammogram involves and how that system works, whereas this is an unknown. so i would probably go with the current system until i knew more.",6,,"knowing that my results would be reviewed by my gp ,having more technical information about how the device works ,having more information about what to expect during the examination before making an appointment ,being able to ""drop in"" and have an examine without needing an appointment,receiving information on how the device supports specialist nhs services",knowing that my results would be reviewed by my gp,aving more technical information about how the device works,having more information about what to expect during the examination before making an appointment ,being able to “drop in” and have an examine without needing an appointment,,receiving information on how the device supports specialist nhs services,,,,,,"yes, definitely","i think the imaging aspect is fine but unsure about the palpation aspect.
lumps can be deep within the breast tissue so how will the system know how hard to press to find lumps if they are there, particularly when everyone varies in size?
not all breast cancer presents as a lump. an examination by a human would look at other aspects such as the skin which may not be picked up by this system.","how it worked
